## Auto implementation for Node trait

Implementing the `Node` trait for tons of custom types is a bit of a waste of time.
for example you need to implement the `id` method for all of them, which just return 
a `NodeId` but you have to write such code over and over again.

Dagrs provides the [procedural macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#procedural-macros-for-generating-code-from-attributes) 
`auto_node` to simplify implementing the `Node` trait for custom types. As the following example
goes, macro `auto_node` will add neccery fields to your custom type, and implement the
`Node` trait for this type.

```rust showLineNumbers
use dagrs::{auto_node}

#[auto_node]
struct MyNode {/*Put customized fields here.*/}

#[auto_node]
struct MyNodeGeneric<T, 'a> {
    my_field: Vec<T>,
    my_name: &'a str,
}

#[auto_node]
struct MyUnitNode;
```
<Note type="note" title="Note">
  The macro `auto_node` currently doen't work on [tuple structs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#using-tuple-structs-without-named-fields-to-create-different-types).
