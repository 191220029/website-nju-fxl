## Auto implementation for Node trait

Implementing the `Node` trait for tons of custom types is a bit of a waste of time.
for example you need to implement the `id` method for all of them, which just return 
a `NodeId` but you have to write such code over and over again.

Dagrs provides the [procedural macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#procedural-macros-for-generating-code-from-attributes) 
`auto_node` to simplify implementing the `Node` trait for custom types. As the following example
goes, macro `auto_node` will add neccery fields to your custom type, and implement the
`Node` trait for this type.

```rust showLineNumbers
use dagrs::{auto_node}

#[auto_node]
struct MyNode {/*Put customized fields here.*/}

#[auto_node]
struct MyNodeGeneric<T, 'a> {
    my_field: Vec<T>,
    my_name: &'a str,
}

#[auto_node]
struct MyUnitNode;
```
<Note type="note" title="Note">
  The macro `auto_node` currently doen't work on [tuple structs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#using-tuple-structs-without-named-fields-to-create-different-types).
</Note>

## Auto implementation for build the graph

Dagrs also provides an easy way to build a graph using the `dependencies!` macro. This eliminates the need to manually add nodes and edges one by one, saving time and making the process more straightforward. The macro allows you to define node dependencies directly in a concise and readable format.

Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating how to use the `dependencies!` macro to construct a graph:

```rust showLineNumbers
use dagrs::dependencies;
let s = MyNode::new(node_name, &mut node_table);
let a = MyNode::new(node_name, &mut node_table);
let b = MyNode::new(node_name, &mut node_table);
let mut g = dependencies!(
        s -> a b,
        b -> a
);
```

The nodes `s`, `a`, and `b` are created using the `MyNode` type, which automatically implements the `Node` trait via the `auto_node` macro. The `dependencies!` macro defines the relationships between nodes in a concise format, where `s -> a b` indicates that there is a channel from `s` to `a` and `b`, and `b -> a` specifies a channel from `b` to `a`. This macro simplifies graph construction by automatically generating the required structure with all specified nodes and their dependencies, avoiding repetitive and boilerplate code.

The `g` variable represents the generated graph, which is automatically constructed by the `dependencies!` macro based on the defined node relationships.
