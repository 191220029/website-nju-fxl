title: Node
description: Abstraction of a task.
---

In Dagrs, we provide the trait `Node` as the representation of 
user's task. `Node` is the basic scheduling unit of [`Graph`](./graph).

## Node's interfaces
```rust showLineNumbers 
pub trait Node: Send + Sync {
    /// id is the unique identifier of each node, it will be assigned 
    /// by the [`NodeTable`].
    /// when creating a new node, you can find this node through 
    /// this identifier.
    fn id(&self) -> NodeId;
    /// The node's name.
    fn name(&self) -> NodeName;
    /// Input Channels of this node.
    fn input_channels(&mut self) -> &mut InChannels;
    /// Output Channels of this node.
    fn output_channels(&mut self) -> &mut OutChannels;
    /// Execute a run of this node.
    fn run(&mut self, env: Arc<EnvVar>) -> Output;
}
```

The above methods ensure the communication and execution function when `Graph` schedules Tasks.

## Dynamic execution logics 
It is possible to execute different logic on the same data layout. So we provide trait 
`Action` as the abstraction of a task's logic.

Here is an example of implementing `Action`, that simply returns `Output::Out` containing a String "Hello world".

```rust showLineNumbers 
use dagrs::{Action, InChannels, OutChannels, EnvVar, Output};
/// An implementation of [`Action`] that returns [`Output::Out`] containing a String "Hello world".
#[derive(Default)]
pub struct HelloAction;
#[async_trait]
impl Action for HelloAction {
    async fn run(&self, _: &mut InChannels, _: &OutChannels, _: Arc<EnvVar>) -> Output {
        Output::Out(Some(Content::new("Hello world".to_string())))
    }
}
```

## Create a node

### Get a node id
Before creating a new node, let's first get to know the `NodeTable` - a mapping of nodes' names to their ids.
During runtime, we need to figure out the specific node to send/receive messages to/from it. Therefore, each node will be assigned 
a unique id before the run.

You can call the `alloc_id_for` method of `NodeTable` to alloc an id by providing a name, just like the following example.

```rust showLineNumbers {4}
use dagrs::NodeTable;
let node_table = NodeTable::default();
let name = "Node Name";
let id = node_table.alloc_id_for(name);
```


### Create a default node

If you don't need a `Node` to hold any extra information, `DefaultNode` is the best choice.

We can create a `DefaultNode` with a 
custom `Action` and other necceray fields. The example below creates a `DefaultNode` with a name of
"My Node", an action of `HelloAction` (defined above), a `NodeId` assigned by the `node_table`, and empty
input_channels and output_channels.

```rust showLineNumbers 
use dagrs::{NodeName, NodeTable, DefaultNode, EmptyAction};

let node_name = "My Node";
let mut node_table = NodeTable::new();
let mut node = DefaultNode::with_action(
    NodeName::from(node_name),
    HelloAction::default(),
    &mut node_table,
);

// Check if node table has key-value pair (node.name, node.id)
assert_eq!(node_table.get(node_name).unwrap(), &node.id());

let env = Arc::new(EnvVar::new(node_table));
let out = node.run(env).get_out().unwrap();
let out: &String = out.get().unwrap();
assert_eq!(out, "Hello world");
```

### Implement a customized node

Don't worry if the `DefaultNode` can't satisfy your need.
You are free to implement a customized `Node` like the following example:

```rust showLineNumbers 
use std::sync::Arc;

use dagrs::{Content, EnvVar, InChannels, Node, NodeId, NodeName, OutChannels, Output};

struct MessageNode {
    id: NodeId,
    name: NodeName,
    in_channels: InChannels,
    out_channels: OutChannels,
    /*Put your custom fields here.*/
    message: String,
}

impl Node for MessageNode {
    fn id(&self) -> NodeId {
        self.id
    }

    fn name(&self) -> NodeName {
        self.name.clone()
    }

    fn input_channels(&mut self) -> &mut InChannels {
        &mut self.in_channels
    }

    fn output_channels(&mut self) -> &mut OutChannels {
        &mut self.out_channels
    }

    fn run(&mut self, _: Arc<EnvVar>) -> Output {
        Output::Out(Some(Content::new(self.message.clone())))
    }
}
```

The `MessageNode` above simply returns its field `message` when run. If needed,
the execution logic of this node can also be replaced with an `Action`, just like the 
`DefaultNode`.

If you need many custom Nodes like this, it can be annoying to duplicate these necceray fields
and methods required by the `Node` trait. The [`auto_node`](./parser#auto-implementation-of-a-node) macro can help you out.
