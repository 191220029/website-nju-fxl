Welcome to **Dagrs**! Dagrs is an easy-to-use, high-performance asynchronous task programming framework written in Rust.
Dagrs follows the concept of Flow based Programming, and aims to provide users with convenient programming interface.

##  Open Source Philosophy

Dagrs is proudly **open-source**! ðŸŽ‰ We believe in creating an accessible, collaborative platform that thrives on community contributions.

## Project Overview

### Flow based Programming
[Flow-based Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming) was invented by J. Paul Morrison in the early 1970s. It was initially implemented in software for a Canadian bank. 
Over the years, itâ€™s had various names but has always maintained its core principles of reducing development time and managing processes efficiently.

### Dagrs's role in your project

When you orchestrate multitasking applications asynchronously, you can make them scale better by reducing the cost of performing multiple operations simultaneously. 
However, writing correct asynchronous code and managing communication between different tasks is annoying. 
Dagrs provides convenient task abstraction and asynchronous running & communication mechanisms to reduce development costs.

### Key Features

| **Feature**                   | **Description**                                          |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| "Black box" Processes         | Encapsulated processes and information packets. |
| Independent Network Construction |The external definition of connections.|
| Asynchronism                   | Asynchronous execution of processes and asynchronous communication.                |
| Ownership and Lifetime        | Information packets with unique ownership and lifetime. |
| Bounded and Finite Connction| Connections between processes are bounded, with a finite capacity.|
| Reverse Pressure | Congestion control when there are too many packets. |


## Technology & Libraries

Dagrs leverages cutting-edge technologies to ensure functionality and performance:

- **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** - A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.
- **[tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)** - An event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing asynchronous I/O backed applications.
- **[async_trait](https://crates.io/crates/async-trait)** - Type erasure for async trait methods.
