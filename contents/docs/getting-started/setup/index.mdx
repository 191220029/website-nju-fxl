## Getting Help

At any point, if you get stuck, you can always get help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/4JzaNkRP). 
Don't worry about asking "begginger" questions. We all start somewhere and 
are happy to help.

## Prerequisites
Readers should already be familiar with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). The [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is an excellent resource to get started with.

While not required, some experience with writing networking code using the [Rust standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) or another language can be helpful.

## Install Dagrs as a Library

With the help of Rust's package manager [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/), everything will be easy to install Dagrs as a Library.

  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Checking Rust installation">
    Before getting started, you should make sure that you have the Rust toolchain installed and ready to go. 
    If you don't have it, the easiest way to install it is using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
    
    The most recent stable version of Rust is recommended.

    To check that Rust is installed on your computer, run the following:

    ```plaintext
    rustc --version
    ```

    You should see output like `rustc 1.81.0 (eeb90cda1 2024-09-04)`.

  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Creating a Project with Cargo">
    Letâ€™s create a new Rust project named `dagrs_setup` using Cargo:

    ```plaintext
    cargo new dagrs_setup
    cd dagrs_setup
    ```
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Install Dagrs as dependency">
    Run the following Cargo command in your project directory:

    ```plaintext
    cargo add dagrs
    ```
    Or add the following line to your Cargo.toml:
    
    ```plaintext
    dagrs = "0.2.0"
    ```
  </StepperItem>

## Ready to go 
That's it, everything is ready to go.
