## Dagrs at RustWeek 2025

Dagrs has been selected as a [GOSIM Rust Spotlight](https://spotlight.gosim.org/rust2025) project at [RustWeek 2025](https://rustweek.org/)! 
GOSIM Rust Spotlight is a prestigious program that recognizes outstanding open-source projects that demonstrate innovation, technical excellence, and community impact. Being selected as a GOSIM Spotlight project is a significant achievement that puts Dagrs in the company of other groundbreaking Rust projects.

This year, Rustweek took place in a cinema in Utrecht, and provided [replays of each talk](https://rustweek.org/live).
We are honored to present our work at the stage of RustWeek. During RustWeek, we also talked to Rust enthusiasts about dagrs.
The Rust team was impressed that the relevant personnel of the dora project team had in-depth discussions with us 
and they hoped that dagrs could be used in the [dora](https://github.com/dora-rs/dora)(Dataflow-Oriented Robotic Architecture) project, 
which will also become part of the future work plan of dagrs.
